# Frontend Foundations

This repository documents my complete frontend and MERN stack journey — from scratch-built UI using **HTML, CSS, JS** to **React** projects and full-stack **MERN** apps.

## 🔗 Modules
### 1. HTML-CSS-JS Projects
- Beginner UI components and mini-projects built with vanilla technologies.

### 2. React Basics
- Core React practice: components, props, hooks, etc and also node and express basics.

### 3. MERN Stack Projects
- Full-stack apps combining MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## 🚀 Purpose
To master frontend development step-by-step, build real-world UI, and deploy full-stack web applications using modern tools.
